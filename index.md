## Renewable Energy CLI Project Blog

My CLI project began with researching my fellow Flatiron School student blogs at Learn.co/magazine. I wanted to learn of students' experiences, how they approached their projects and the challenges they faced. Reading through dozens of projects served as a source of inspiration, and helped me to focus my thoughts and find a unique topic to address.

As an exotic pet owner, did I want to work on a pet-oriented web scraper? Or something truer to my activism? Google searches for exotic pet organizations revealed a plethora of websites with inconsistencies in listings and advice. Being picky, I decided to table the exotic pets idea until I can find a solid reputable organization.

Another idea was something about renewable energy, such as solar or wind power. I spent a day in online search. Most results on U.S. sites would be roughly 150 links. I also wanted something more global, with recovery to island nations in mind. That's when I found an organization that navigates and provides aid for all types of renewable energy.

I ended up scraping a total of seven web pages for my CLI project. I feel comfortable with web scraping from my experience working with HTML and CSS. What I underestimated was matching seven different menu selections with the return of the correct web scraped content. I was looking for alternatives to using a case statement. As I write this blog, I am still working on the code for this. Another challenge was initial set up while familiarizing myself with Visual Studio Code.

Goal: Using pry more often.
